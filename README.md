currently the only code that was implemented is the manager menu.

this is the WIP version, so there us still alot too make and inprove.
i want the same resault as the prototype, but a more effiecent, and better looking code.

i am currently busy with trying to put the student and teacher menu into the code without adding too much lines.
also i am remaking the grades system, it doesn't look that good, and when u have a 0 or a 100, the entire student list breaks.

i already added something that botherd me with the old code, and that was that if u where too see the student list,
not everything was on the same line. so i sorta fixed that, if u just add normal birthday and group, then i works, else it breaks.
