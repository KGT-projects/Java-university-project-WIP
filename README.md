currently the only code that was implemented is the manager menu.

this is the WIP version, so there us still alot to make and inprove.
i want the same result as the prototype, but a more effiecent, and better looking code.
the prototype code u can vind here: https://github.com/KGT-projects/Java-university-project-prototype

i am currently busy with trying to put the student and teacher menu into the code without adding too much lines.
also i am remaking the grades system, it doesn't look that good, and when u have a 0 or a 100, the entire student list breaks.

i already added something that botherd me with the old code, that is the student / teacher list.
not everything was on the same line. so i sorta fixed that, if u just add normal birthday and group, then i works, else it doesn't look really good.
